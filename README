arXivRadio: arXiv scraper and machine reader

This is a ruby script that scrapes e-print site http://arxiv.org/,
edits its content in a radio news style, and feeds it to a
text-to-speech program.

By default, it reads out astro-ph/new. You can change this by editing
the following line of the script:

NEWS_URL = "http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new"

#### Requirements

- ruby
- hpricot, a ruby gem

and either
- Festival Text To Speech http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/
- say, Mac's default Speech Synthesis Manager
